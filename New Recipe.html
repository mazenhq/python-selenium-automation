       <H4> <li>The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.
                When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then, measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and leveling it with a knife.</li>
            <li>Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.

                Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
            <li> Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

                Use LOTS of chocolate chips. You want at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.</li>
            <li>The chocolate chip cookie dough should be easy to roll and not sticky. It should not be dry or crumbly.</li>
            <li>Once the cookie dough is finished, it’s time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.</li>
           <li>Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. I love this stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies.</li>
           <li>If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.

           <li>The most important piece of advice I can give you is – DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! They will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.</li>
